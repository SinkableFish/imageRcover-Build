Image processing
==
***Visual IOT left homework to recovery or rebuild 7 images due to different methonds. So, let's start with the first one:***<br>
* The first one is to cut out the lincense plate, use bin-morphology. Specifically I firstly use 90 degrees line erosion to break lines then use dilation with the model 60*100 rectangle to stand the plate area out. The result is shown below:

<img src="./results/1.png" width=45%/>
</center>
Then cut the numbers out:<br>
<center>
<img src="./results/1-1.jpg" width=10%/>
<img src="./results/1-2.jpg" width=10%/>
<img src="./results/1-3.jpg" width=10%/>
<img src="./results/1-4.jpg" width=10%/>
<img src="./results/1-5.jpg" width=10%/>
<img src="./results/1-6.jpg" width=10%/>
</center>
The rest markdown I will find time to upload~~~~
